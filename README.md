# 🔁 ANN-Based Customer Churn Classification

This project applies an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** to predict **customer churn**, helping businesses identify clients likely to leave. The solution uses structured customer data and deep learning models built with **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.

---

## 📊 Problem Statement

Customer churn is a major issue in subscription-based businesses. This project aims to:
- Predict churn probability based on historical data
- Reduce customer attrition
- Improve retention strategies using actionable insights

---

## 🧠 Model Overview

- ✅ **Model Type:** Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- 📦 **Libraries:** TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- 🧹 **Preprocessing:** Label encoding, one-hot encoding, feature scaling
- 🔍 **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔢 Processes structured customer data
- 🧠 Trains a multi-layer ANN for churn classification
- 📈 Evaluates performance with classification metrics
- 📦 Includes clean training & prediction pipeline

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Python 3.10+**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **Pandas / NumPy / Matplotlib / Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**
