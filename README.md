# ðŸ§  ANN-Based Customer Churn Classification

A complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting customer churn using **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**, built with TensorFlow and deployed using **Streamlit**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical business challenge. This project leverages an ANN model to predict whether a customer will leave a bank based on key features such as credit score, age, balance, geography, etc.

### âœ… Key Highlights:
- End-to-end ML pipeline: preprocessing â†’ model training â†’ deployment
- Uses TensorFlow/Keras for ANN
- Real-time predictions with a user-friendly Streamlit web app
- Persisted encoders and scalers for consistent inference
- Simple UI for business users to test different customer profiles
